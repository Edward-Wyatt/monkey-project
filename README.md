# monkey-project
Welcome to the monkey project, a collection of different programs and algorithms that simulate variations of the "monkeys on typewriters" thought experiment.
a lot of the programs here, though designed to return the works of shakespeare from random events, will not do so in any reasonable timeframe, so it's not recommended to try to run the programs, since a lot of them can take days, some even may take years to complete.
